# Battleship Board

This program in Java is an interactive Battleship Board where the user can choose where to shoot 
and the program will respond accordingly.

It checks if:

* Input character is valid
* Board is valid
* How many sunken ships there are on the board
* Check if a selected area to hit has been hit, missed or repeated
* Counts ships on board and categorises them into damaged, undamaged, sunk, or all types
and which type of ship it is: carrier, battleship, cruiser or destroyer
